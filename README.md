# Hi, Iâ€™m Isaac ðŸ‘‹
A highly motivated software engineering student at the University of Gothenburg, currently in my second year of study. I have a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development. My academic projects and collaborative experiences have sharpened my abilities in problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. Eager to apply and expand my skillset in a practical and collaborative environment, I am seeking a 2024 summer internship that will allow me to contribute to real-world projects.
