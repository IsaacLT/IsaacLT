# Hi, Iâ€™m Isaac ðŸ‘‹
A highly motivated software engineering student at the University of Gothenburg, currently in my second year of study. I have a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development. My academic projects and collaborative experiences have sharpened my abilities in problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication. Eager to apply and expand my skillset in a practical and collaborative environment, I am seeking a 2024 summer internship that will allow me to contribute to real-world projects. 
# Projects
## Flossboss
The FlossBoss project is a web-based system for dental appointment management that combines a client/server model with a service-oriented approach to efficiently manage dental appointments. Employing a React-based Patient GUI on the front end and an Express.js server on the back end for user data handling through HTTP REST API. The system leverages MQTT as a communication protocol, where the server, instead of direct database operations for bookings, publishes booking requests and subscribes to booking confirmations, enabling real-time updates via SSE. The Service Layer encapsulates the booking logic, dentist authentication, email notifications, and logging, with services subscribing to and publishing on MQTT topics for a decoupled, event-driven workflow that provides real-time notifications, enhancing user experience and system maintainability.

## Shusher
The Shusher project is a multi-platform system combining micro-controllers, sensors and actuators with software. The projectâ€™s purpose is to develop a system that warns a user when exceeding a given noise level threshold. The system's integrates a WIO Terminal with sensors and uses the C programming language for effective communication and data exchange, ensuring precise sensor readings. Additionally, the Shusher application is developed with JavaFX, employing scene-builder for a rich, user-friendly interface.
